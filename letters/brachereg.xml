				<note>
					<p>Elmer G. Bracher, Rutgers College class of 1918, was born in 1894 in Rahway, New Jersey, to parents George S. Bracher (1839-1902) and Evelina Johnson (1853-1923). He was the youngest of six children (five sons and one daughter). As a local of Rahway, Bracher and Silvers knew each others' families well. Elmer goes by the nickname &quot;Pi-an&quot; or &quot;Pian&quot; in these letters, the origin of which remains mysterious (to us, at least). Elsewhere, classmates refer to him as &quot;Toady&quot; Bracher.</p>
					<p>Bracher's desire to communicate fairly bursts from the page. It's clear that the College, his fellow football teammates (Bracher was a star halfback despite his small stature), and the Delta Phis (his and Silvers's fraternity) constitute his chosen family. He is conspicuously silent about his biological family, despite the fact that Silvers would have known them from town, and Bracher shipped out of Hoboken with his older brother Robert. Bracher's other topics---who is getting married or engaged, and being at the rear versus the front of the war effort---reveal a preoccupation with masculinity. One senses that the war to him is a giant impediment to maturity. Not only did it cut short his football career, but being stationed at a base hospital in Savenay, France, hundreds of miles from the Front, meant that he couldn't as easily demonstrate conventional soldierly notions of nobility or strength. Nor could he become engaged. He is clearly stung by the news of Mildred Terrill's engagement. Terrill, who Bracher calls "the Voice" (a singer?), was Earl Reed Silvers's sister-in-law and apparently Rahway's own Helen of Troy. Bracher is not the only one to write of her; in a more humorous vein, Ainsworth claims to be "sore as hell at being thrown over" for Lyle B. Reeb (RC 1919).</p>
					<p>Bracher's letters show a certain tonedeafness on the subject of illness and death. He refers to "nut patients" and a "nut hospital" (Base Hospital No. 214, also at Savenay) when speaking of the war's shell shock victims. Of Morris B. Jackson (RC 1919) dying of the flu, he says "[i]t certainly was too bad." And of Chapin Barr (RC 1918) and Rudolph Elmer's (RC 1917) deaths, he merely states that it was news to him that they "kick[ed] in." Bracher himself would die four years after demobilization. He crashed his Stutz touring car into a stationary truck in the early hours of Sunday morning, September 30, 1923, after watching the Rutgers-Penn Military College football game the prior evening. He is thought to have died at the scene.</p>

				<p>It will probably take me quite a time to compose this letter, with you being a
					critic and it having to pass the censor. So you know it's
					pretty hard to write without putting something in that shouldn't be in, so make
					some allowances. How are you and Eda and everyone else? Are you still running
					the college? What's <persName key="Ainsworth, William Penn Esterbrook (Pete)" from="1893" to="1968" role="Captain, Coast Artillery Corps" ref="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QPZX-648V">Pete</persName> doing now? For the Lord's sake write to a person once
					in a while and tell me some news. You ought to be with me if you want to save
					money. I'm working on the night shift and have spent about twelve francs in the last
					week. four of that going for laundry and two for some towels. My gosh! if that
					had been all the money I spent a week while at college, I'd have been a rich
					man. We work in twelve hour shifts and one certainly is glad when the twelve hours
					are up. I go on at six P.M. and am off at six A.M. We eat breakfast at seven and
					then generally sleep from eight until four. Who did you think is in town? Old

						Janeway</persName>. It certainly was a mighty pleasant surprise to see him.
					Had dinner with him the first night and that meal certainly did taste good after
					the food we had been having aboard ship. We certainly had a peach of a voyage
					over. Only had one rough night and that wasn't enough to make one seasick.
					Believe me, I certainly was glad that I wasn't seasick. I'm stationed in a new
					addition to the hospital and there are no electric lights in it. Have to see by
					candlelight, that accounts for my spilling some on this paper. It certainly is a
					mighty fine night here tonight. There's a most wonderful moon out and it almost
					makes one wish he were home again. Well, Pro, don't forget to write as often as
					you can and if you publish any books, send me one. Give my best regards to Eda
					and everyone else. Hoping I'll see you soon.</p>

				<p> Received your letter of Sept. 8 yesterday and it sure was fine to hear from you.

					bit of pain or hurt. I sure hope it is a boy so we'll have another
						Delt in the Silvers family. Say Pro, tell the "Voice" to
					write more often. I've only heard from her once since I've been here. Also tell
					her not to forget to send me an announcement. All the fellows wanted to be
					remembered to you. They are all well and making out very nicely. Work seems to
					agree with us all. I can hardly imagine that college has opened and that I would
					be able to go back. It certainly could be great if all the old gang could get
					together again. When we <pb n="10"/> all get back we'll have to have a grand old
					reunion. That's fine news about Pete. Tell him to let me know his address. Dud
					surely did a mighty fine thing. I know that I would never have done it if I had
					been in his position. If everybody has his spirit we sure would have a mighty
					fine army. I guess I'll stop rambling now Pro. Give my best regards to everyone. So long </p>

				</opener>
				<p>Do you know I haven't heard from you in a deuce of a while? I thought I would
					drop you a line to see if you would answer it to let me know whether you're
					still alive or not. I've been receiving the College letters regularly as have
					all of the other fellows here. They are mighty good to read, but, I'd much
					rather hear from you personally. I certainly have heard some surprising news
					lately. Shrimp White's and <persName key="Browning, Oren Fogle" from="1893" to="1963" role="Corporal, Infantry" ref="https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/T3B56NM4"><sic>Bone's</sic> Browning</persName>'s engagements and
					the <unclear>Louse's</unclear> marriage, <pb n="21"/> they certainly are things
					I never did expect to hear at least not for some time to come. How are Eda and
					the baby? I sure hope they are well and that you have nothing to worry about.
					I've been put on a new job lately. Have charge of a new kitchen <add place="above">&amp; mess hall</add> which we have just started. It isn't
					finished yet but, when it is it's going to be the best in the hospital. I have
					to order the stores and draw them, make out the menu and see that the work
					around the kitchen and hall is done right. With the exception of one cook all
					the work is done by convalescent patients, and I generally <pb n="22"/> have
					quite a job to find them and to do the work. Have three good men who are
						detailed permanently and that helps a lot. The worst part
					of it is that you generally get some good men broken in and then they are sent
					back to duty again. — Have to start all over again then. We
						still lead the staid respectable life as of yore. Go to
					bed at a quarter to ten or before and go to <seg xml:id="fn6">reveille</seg><note type="gloss" resp="#GH" target="#fn6" anchored="true"><p>a signal used to awaken personnel in the armed forces, typically

				<p>Received your letter yesterday and it surely was as unexpected as it was welcome.
					I had inde<subst><del rend="overwritten">d</del><add>e</add></subst> thought you had forgotten all about me, and had given up all hope of
					hearing from you. I have been receiving the college letter right along and of
					course receive all the college news thru it, but, it isn't near as good as
					hearing from you directly. Things are going along here about the same as usual.
					Of course the hospital is growing larger and expanding all the while. Instead of
					one hospital now it has become <pb n="24"/> a hospital center. <seg xml:id="fn7">Base 8</seg><note type="annotation" resp="#GH" target="#fn7" anchored="true"><p>Base
							Hospital No. 8 was the one of the largest American military-operated hospitals in
							France. It handled both medical and surgical patients until August 1918.

					quite a few other units forming the component parts of the center. I believe
					that each unit is to have twenty five hundred beds and the center as a whole is

					a room in an old French house which is on the grounds of the Camp. There is an
					open fireplace in the room and it surely makes it mighty cosy and comfortable in
					the evening when we have a fire agoing. The evenings <pb n="26"/> are generally
					pretty cool now so I usually camp by the fire and read or write or work as the
					spirit moves me. Sil, I don't believe you will receive many letters from the
					fellows in this unit, for there really isn't a thing of interest to write about.
					It seems to us all that we should be up at the front doing something worth
					while, instead of being stuck away back here. We're just plain out of luck as it
					is. I'm enclosing a little poem which is mighty applicable to the whole bunch
					here. With the changing of a few words it would fit us to a T. <pb n="27"/> I

				<p>How in the world do you expect me to know that you are a sergeant unless you tell

				<p>What the devil is the matter with you anyhow? You started off writing like a

					</choice> my fault. I have answered every letter that I have received from you,
					so what more can a man do? Anyway I'm giving you this last chance. Don't think
					I'll write again until I hear from you. Steve White just came back from the
					States the other day and said that he had been down to the college and that he
					had seen you. He also said that we had trimmed Penn State and that we had a darn
					good team. You know I sure would like to see a good game of football again. Guess that I'd pretty nearly go crazy to see the old team play again. If

						<orig>Isure</orig>
						<corr>I sure</corr>
					</choice> hope that you <choice>
						<orig>havent</orig>
						<corr>haven't</corr>

					Rahway boy that has been at the hospital and it was rather nice to see him even
					if I <choice>
						<orig>didnt</orig>
						<corr>didn't</corr>
					</choice> know him very well. Gosh I pretty nearly forgot to tell you that I had
					seen old Delamater. Harry Janeway called up and said that he was in port so I
					took a trip down to see him. First time I had seen him for pretty nearly a year
					and a half but, he was the same old Del. <choice>
						<orig>Dont</orig>
						<corr>Don't</corr>

					that his next trip would be to Belfast, Ireland and that he would return to St.
					Nazaire so I may see him again in a couple of weeks. I sure hope so for it
					certainly was fine to see him again. The peeper had another sick spell lately.
					Think that it was the diptheria that he had this time. He is over now and on a
					seven day leave in Paris. His dad is at Paris doing Red Cross work so that is
					how he obtained his pass. It sure is pretty nice for him <choice>
						<orig>isnt</orig>
						<corr>isn't</corr>
					</choice> it? Wish that I was in his <choice>
						<orig>boot s</orig>
						<corr>boots</corr>
					</choice> for the time being. He also was promoted awhile ago. Is a sergeant
					now. Guess that that is all the news that I know about the fellows. The rest of
					the Rutgers Bunch are all in good health and crabbing about the same as usual.
					Let me have Shrimp White's address, will you Sil? Had a letter from him awhile
					ago and then lost it. Lost his address along with the letter and as I would like
					to answer it I wish that you would sent it to me. What has ever become of
					Pete Ainsworth and Bub and Eddie and the rest of the gang. I know that
					they are over here but that is all that I do know about them. Heard from Ronald
					Acken a while ago. He was in a hospital with a slight dose of mustard gas. he
					was just about to be discharged then so I guess that he is all right. Must close
					now and try to write a couple of other letters. Give my best regards to Eda and

				<p>How the deuce are you all and why don't you write once in a while? Of course I

					ever thought you would publish it. I sure will wallop you for doing it when I
					get back. I don't believe that there is any chance of sending any souvenirs of

					have done. But, now that I'm in I don't mind it so much for I'm used to it now.
