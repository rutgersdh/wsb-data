				<note><p>Jacob W. Groendyke was born in Monmouth Junction, NJ, in 1891 to parents Jacob J. Groendyke and Christiana Hutchinson. He attended New Brunswick High School in addition to Rutgers, where he graduated as a member of the class of 1912.</p> 
					
					<p>Prior to the war, Groendyke served as a clerk in the accounting department of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. in New York City. He entered the war as a noncommissioned officer with Company "E", 312th infantry, 78th division. His position was in the intelligence section. A letter to a family member briefly describes the nightly "airplane exhibition[s]" used to gather intelligence about German positions. Groendyke had been promoted to first lieutenant by the time he left France from the port of Brest on December 24, 1918. After demobilization, he returned to American Telephone and Telegraph, where he continued until his retirement in 1956 as a vice president of accounting.</p>
					
					<p>Groendyke's letters of July 1918 have an elegiac quality to them. As nearly as we can estimate, his division would have been in the vicinity of Oudezeele, France, close to the Flemish border, together with the First British Army. This would have been a staging area for an eventual troop movement south to Arras. Thomas Meehan's history confirms Groendyke's account of constant air fights, high-explosive shells, and moonlight bombings. This part of the country would have been long ago evacuated by residents, hence the abandoned livestock and unharvested crops Groendyke observes. Perhaps it is the book-keeper in him that can't resist remarking on the war's extravagant waste of animals, food, shelter, and materials, not to mention human lives.</p>

					at the window and of <unclear reason="illegible">General</unclear> about the

				<p> So far as I can recall our extensive correspondence has not been reopened since I notified you that a
					change was about to take place in my address. Well since then we have become
					somewhat widely separated. We had the usual "inconveniences" of a troop ship
					coming over, however we have been quite thoroughly inoculated against
					fretfulness and fatigue so we enjoyed the trip a lot. </p>
				<p> Right after getting clear of harbor gun crews were appointed to work with the gunmen of the boat.
					Since I looked more like a gunman than a gunner they chose me for Sergeant of the
					crew and gun trainer. </p>

				<p> We had only one affair with Subs. This occurred on a calm Sunday night just after mess time. Several
					boats attacked our fleet but none of us was hit. One or two of the enemy were
					sunk by depth charges. When one is below decks and hears the reverberations of
					these charges against the side plates of the ship and he has not experienced the
					sensation before: it immediately makes him think of a cold salt bath. </p>

				<p>By request of my brother Jacob W. Groendyke, I am forwarding to you under separate cover a belt buckle taken by him off a dead hun in no mans land on July 5, 1918. He was there to gain experience in scouting. On July 25 he wrote that due to his performance on the field he had been picked with 34 others to attend Officers Training School, which would probably last through Aug., Sept. and Oct. It is the 3rd series for the First Army Corps. I had word from him two weeks ago and he was still there. I hope he may be spared to return and tell us the details of his experience and of the buckle. </p>
