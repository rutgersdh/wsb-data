				<note><p>Morris "Jill" Jackson put his Rutgers coursework in agriculture to work directing a convalescents' farm at U.S. Base Hospital No. 8 in Savenay France. There, he was joined by seven other Rutgers men working in the Medical Department. In fall 1918, Jackson was sent back to the U.S. to escort a group of officers suffering from shell shock (post-traumatic stress disorder) to the neuro-psychiatry ward of General Hospital No. 30 in Plattsburgh, New York. One senses that this was not a choice assignment; Jackson himself notes in a letter that Don Storck and Mefford Runyon were considered "too valuable" for the trip. In compensation for his effort, Jackson was awarded a 15-day leave to visit his family. He was ill with influenza by the time he reached his parents' home in Brooklyn. His condition worsened until he died on October 27, 1918, aged twenty years old.</p>
					<p>The influenza pandemic of 1918 inflicted five to ten times more casualties than the war (somewhere between 50 and 100 million people died), and yet for a time, as scholars like Elizabeth Outka point out, it was seemingly forgotten. Outka writes: "The war was what seemed real, and war deaths were what seemed important. Flu deaths were difficult to spin into stories of victory or needful sacrifices. The disease suggested bodily vulnerability and weakness, not a masculine power struggle or a larger political goal."</p>
					<p>In the letters that follow, and in the above clippings of his obituaries, we see this forgetting happening in real time as Jackson's flu death is reclaimed as a war death. Both the obituary printed in the <title>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</title> and his father's letter to Earl Reed Silvers devote several paragraphs to Jackson's war service and only a cursory mention of  his death from influenza. There were simply no words for this tragedy that was unfolding in the war's shadow.</p>
					<p>If Jackson's death could be made comprehensible and grievable as a war death, no such treatment is reserved for the victims of shell shock. It is hard to miss the contempt that Knights of Columbus representative J. K. Paulding has for the officers Jackson accompanies back to the United States. His letter to Mrs. Jackson eulogizes Jackson in part by contrasting his "beautiful spirit" with the "degraded beings" in his care. In historian Elaine Showalter's view, a much discussed "crisis of masculinity" during the First World War reached its paroxysm with shell shock, a masculine mirror of what psychiatrists had previously understood to be the uniquely feminine condition of hysteria.</p>

				<p>I dont know how we'll ever get used to real American weather again. Over here you

				<p>From the top of our hill which is the highest around, you can see <placeName key="Saint-Nazaire, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=47_16_50_N_2_12_31_W">St. Nazaire</placeName>. On all sides, oats, wheat, and rye make checker
					boards out of the flat rolling country The houses, red roofed, with white
					colored, clean in the distance and dirty in reality make good substitutes for
					chess men. Every now and then about five people got together and built a million
					dollar church and started a town. Every town has a church that they'D think twice about the cost of building back home,

				<p>On One side of the farm is a dam which has made the A. E. F. engineers famous
					truly a masterpiece of concrete, on another the railroad runs just under the
					hill and all day along big trains of freight drawn by Baldwin locomotives, every
					car carrying a U.S.A on the side<add>,</add> tear by carrying supplies to
					somewhere. On still another side is the main highway where train after train of
					trucks pass by with men, supplies and accessories for other somewheres that the
					railroad dont reach. <sic>Andstill</sic> on the other side of the hill is an
					American Quarry where American engineers are making big ones into little ones
					while the U.S. mules he-haw at the dump wagons. So you see we are rather well
					Americanized.</p>
				<p>Jimmy Williams has left for the front. It's too bad I didn't get a chance to see
					him before his company left. He was quite near too. He's a corporal.</p>

				<p>Poor <persName key="Storck, Donald G." role="Sergeant, Medical Corps" from="1897" to="1987">Don Storck</persName> and Meff Runyon feel pretty bad. They were
					picked with four other men to take charge of a number of psycopathic cases which
					are going back to the States. The boys of course, expected to get a bit of time
					at home but when the major saw the list he said Storck and Runyon are too
					valuable around here so they don't get to go.</p>

				<p>We expect to entertain the patients who have worked here on the farm on the
					Fourth of July. The nurses will provide sandwiches and cocoa for them "and a

				<p><seg xml:id="fn14">I have just heard of Morris' death</seg><note target="#fn14" type="annotation"><p>Typewritten transcript of a letter that W. W. Jackson sent to Silvers to be copied.</p></note>, and cannot forbear writing you a line, even
					at the risk of intruding upon your great grief. I don't know when I have met a
					finer boy, and I had learned how to love him almost as a son. I shall never
					visit the farm again, where he was stationed latterly, without a feeling of mute
					pain. I used to go there occasionally to take supper with the boys, and the
					chief pleasure to me was sitting afterwards in the doorway or on the flagging
					and talking with him. It seems to me now as if I could never bear taking supper
					there again.</p>

				<p>I had a postal card from him written on his arrival at <placeName key="Newport News, VA" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=36_58_6_N_76_25_45_W">Newport News</placeName> in which he said he wished he had not left here,
					he had seen too much of the world since leaving. I know he referred to the
					nursing and horror of the demented, and I am afraid often degraded beings whom
					he had to care for on his way over. I can imagine the shock it must have been to
					his sensitive nature.</p>

				<p>I remember the beautiful spirit in which he took an unjust criticism levelled at
					the conduct of the Farm in which he took so useful a part. The other man there
					was justly angry and <sic>di</sic> not conceal it. Morris never <add>ceased smiling</add>
					and was moderate in all his comment, it seemed sufficient to him that he had
					done his full duty and it did not too much concern him if there happened to be
					somebody who could not recognize it.</p>

				<p>I often had occasion to recognize in him a higher spirit and one more genuinely
					interested in serious things than in most of the other men about. Perhaps that
					was the result of a different and better home <sic>taining</sic>, but it was
					surprising in a boy so fitted for every sort of outdoor delight to find him
					discriminating in what he read and instinctively averse to the trash that the
					average fellow fares for.</p>

				<p>I have seldom seen a handsomer fellow- what a joy to find a beautiful spirit, a lovely nature, behind the outward beauty: Perhaps, my dear Mrs. Jackson, you can come to feel in time, if not just at
					present, that he is now irrevocably and for all time, what you would wish him to
					be, past danger of change or taint, secure in purity and serenity of his
					youthful manhood. His memory will always remain an inspiration to me.
					The world is the sweeter for his <sic>so journed</sic> among us.</p>

				<p>If you have a photograph of his, that you can spare, I should deeply appeciate
					having it.</p>

				<p>After what I have written, I do not need to tell you how largely I share in the
					grief of his father and yourself, you have my deepest sympathy.</p>

				<p>Thank you very much for your letter of <sic>Novemver</sic> 26th, containing

					Quarterly. If you will advise me of the number of copies you may be able to use,
					I shall be pleased to send them to you.</p>

				<p>Morris' death was a big shock to us here at the college. He always seemed to me
					so vitally alive, so full of a youthful zest in the pure joy of living, that it
					is hard to realize that he has crossed the border. Words in a time like this are
					always futile, but I hope that you will accept my sincere sympathy. It must give
					you a good deal of satisfaction to know that you son's life was clean and
					wholesome and that his death came while he was in the service of the nation</p>

					<p>May I add what I have had in my heart for two years or more - my son Morris B
						Jackson loved Rutgers College - and was proud to represent her <add place="margin">(over)</add></p>

					<pb n="22"/>
					<p><add place="margin">(2)</add> in this Country - before he joined the army -
						and in France when in the U.S. service.</p>

					<p>With Morris I originally chose Rutgers as a College which was backed by a
							<seg xml:id="fn11">live Church</seg><note target="#fn11" type="annotation"><p>It may be worth noting here that Demarest was a

					<p><add place="margin">(3)</add> could get the best kind of an Education. May I
						say that my son and his parents have always believed our choice was the best
