            <p>I received your letter and am glad to hear that you and "friend" are at the shore. It
               will do you both lots of good. Thank "friend" for the postal. It is very nice that
               you have a chance to get a commission but hold off and stay where you are. There are
               plenty to do the work.</p>
            <p>I had to run out just then and take a look at an aeroplane passing over the barracks
               - a big flying boat affair only about 500 feet up.</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>We see all kinds of interesting sights every day - new flying machine, search lights,
               boats and men of war.</p>
            <p>The work continues just about the same. We plug on geometry, trig, and physics; play
               war games, drill on the guns, attend lectures, <unclear>snatch</unclear> half an
               hours swim and wait for Sunday and rest to come.</p>
            <p>The hard thing is not being able to see home or any of you there. There is not the
               excitement of <placeName key="Fort Myer, VA"

                  Myer</placeName> here and that is what makes things go harder. The kind of work we
               have to me however more than compensates for the grind.</p>
            <p> If we go to France it will </p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>be with heavy field and <sic>seige</sic> guns. Some of us will probably be there by
               fall. Don't tell anyone about that however. It would scare my aunt to death. She
               thinks that none of us will ever leave the country.</p>
            <p>Give my best to the "gang" Tell <unclear>Dave</unclear> that I will write him soon
               but not to wait for me to do that little thing.</p>

            <p> I find in making arrangements for disposing of my estate in case anything happens to
               me that I have a couple of rather valuable instruments and one very valuable book
               that I would like to leave to the <placeName key="Rutgers College, New Brunswick, NJ"

                  >College</placeName> as I think they would be used and appreciated there more than
               anywhere else.</p>
            <p> These are: One <unclear>microscope</unclear> with several rather fine English made
                  <pb n="10"/> lenses and French slides which I think are of biological subjects;
               One astronomical instrument built like a sextant very old and probably an antique but
               probably of some service; a book which was written in 1662 (or published at that
               time) about science in general and a reference in it about communication by magnetic
               attraction which is quite singular. </p>

               shall most certainly write to him at least once a week and shall also send him our
               regular college circular which contains the college news. I was mighty sorry that he
               did not drop up to see me the last time he was in Rahway. This is the only time since
               he entered the service that he has neglected us and we did not have a chance,
               therefore, to say good bye to him, however, let us all hope that he may get back
               again soon and that the old good times will be renewed. </p>

               <salute>Dear Reed:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>At last I am "over here" and everything is so peaceful in the locality where I am
               situated that it hardly seems I am in a country which has been at war for four years.
               Of course I am in a place very many miles from the firing line which accounts for the
               tranquility. You must understand, while I censor my own mail, that I cannot reveal
               many things and must deal largely in generalities in writing you. </p>
            <pb n="18"/>
            <p>
               <add place="margin">[2]</add> ( First of all I want to <orig>enquire</orig> for
               "friend-wife" and "Mike" I hope both are as well as ever and suppose "Mike" is
               growing everyday. Tickle him for me. ) </p>
            <p>The trip over was wonderful. The sea was very calm and the weather beautiful all the
               way over except for about two days when it blew up rather rough and as the seas
               caught us sideways the boat rocked to beat the band. It sometimes rocked so that for
               hours if you were sitting on deck you were looking alternatively at the sky above and
               the water beneath you and unless you braced your steamer chair you would slide, chair
               and all across the deck. Many of the men were dreadfully seasick but it did not
               effect me in the least, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>I have often heard what <pb n="19"/>
               <add place="margin">[3]</add> a wonderful sight land is after days at sea but never
               realized is until I saw it at the end of our voyage.</p>
            <p> Of our debarking and train trip I may say little except that the scenery was
               wonderful but in a different way from America. Our beautiful sections as a rule are
               the wild ones but the beautiful sections of France are after the cultivated ones.</p>
            <p>At present our company is billetted in an old French estate surrounded by vineyards.
               The officers live in the chateau which is a great white stone house with a tile roof
               (one of the originals from which the millionnaires take their plans for their seaside
               homes)</p>
            <p>I have a nice big room with an adjoining second floor parlour. In back there is a
               terrace with a <pb n="20"/> palm and rose garden containing a wonderful pagoda. A
               brook with a deep curving hole runs <orig>thru</orig> a nearby meadow and affords the
               men an opportunity for bathing. The days are very warm and the nights cool.</p>
            <p>What more could one ask for?</p>
            <p>I am very well and very happy and, I believe, very fortunate.</p>
            <p>I will write in the near future and want you to do that little thing very often.</p>
            <p>Don't forget the letters from College and the Quarterly.</p>
