            <note>
               <p>William Penn Esterbrook "Pete" Ainsworth was born in Rahway, New Jersey, in 1893. He was the eldest son of George Cornell Ainsworth and Grace Esterbrook. Ainsworth and Earl Reed Silvers lived a few blocks from one another in Rahway, which is presumably how they came to know each other and their families so well. Ainsworth has the affectation of referring to Silvers's wife, Edith Terrill, as "friend"---perhaps a holdover from when they were dating and trying to keep a low profile.</p>
               <p>Ainsworth pursued a technical Bachelor of Science course at Rutgers, where he graduated with honors in mechanical engineering in 1916. He would marry Janet Middleton Ackerman, the little sister of David Greenlie Ackerman, also of Rahway, in 1927. Ainsworth returned to civilian life as a manager at the Combustion Engineering Corporation of New York. He published <title>The development of an automatic combustion control for coal burning</title> <ref target="https://bit.ly/3zq2UV8"/> in 1935.</p>
               <p>During the war, Ainsworth served as a captain in the 57th regiment of the Coast Artillery Corps (CAC). The role of the Coast Artillery was to provide personnel for all US-manned heavy artillery. Somewhat confusingly, this corps was also responsible for railway and anti-aircraft artillery, in addition to coastal defense. As he mentions in a letter to his father, Ainsworth's unit was equipped with French-made weapons, specifically the 155 Grande Puissance Filloux, transported by American Holt tractors (very few American-made weapons arrived to the front before the Armistice). After training at various locations in the U.S. and France, including the Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe and what sounds like a very pleasant chateau in Libourne (Bordeaux country), Ainsworth saw combat in two decisive battles that hastened the war's end: the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.</p>
               <p>The tone of Ainsworth's letters comes fairly close to the soldierly ideal of the time, which is to say it shows an "insouciant courage," a "studied gaiety under fire," and no hint of doubt as to the outcome or the judgement of the leaders who put him there (Horne 1995, p. 226). At first, during his training, Ainsworth reaches for pedestrian topics like his schedule and the food, as if to communicate that everything is normal, more than fine. The contrast with his later descriptions of scrounging for food and supplies, and reclaiming a shed from the rats and the mud, behind what is presumed to be the recently broken Hindenburg Line, is striking. Ainsworth uses jocular language like "party" to describe Allied bombardments and claims to find the nighttime shelling "entertaining." Consistent with contemporaneous views, he sees barbarism written in the physiognomy of German prisoners, who have "the face of a machine." Horror occasionally seeps through his language, as when he describes trying to get his truck out of a shell hole while within range of German field guns. Ainsworth spends several months in France after the Armistice in order to help with the liquidation of U.S. Army supplies. Like many officers, he was granted a leave to tour parts of Western Europe before returning home to the US. He includes an interesting description of the women in post-war Paris in his letter of January 4, 1919. It is hard to tell if he accidentally wandered into a red light district or if this was just another case of "khaki fever." Ainsworth was finally discharged from duty in June 1919.</p>

            <p>The first week of duty is finishing, and in looking back I cannot find a single thing which was not more agreeable than was expected. First, we all had to go to the doctor's and receive two vaccinations, and an injection of antitoxin in the left breast; consequently my arm has a horrible sore on it (it took), and for two days my chest and left arm were very sore.</p>
            <p>Tuesday our regular day started. We arise at 5.15, line up for reveille at 5.30, breakfast at 5.50, and drill from 6.50 until 12, or when we 'mess'. Then we drill from 1.50 until 4.00, ending with an hour's hike until 5.00. We take a shower in ice water (no hot water), have supper at 5.05, and study from 6.30 until 9.30. Lights are out at 9.45. In off moments we make our beds, bathe, take care of our uniform, and learn signalling and orders - all very interesting. Yesterday and to-day (Sunday) I have been walking guard duty (two hours walking, two hours relief, and two hours walking). I am writing this during relief.</p>
            <p>There is a wonderful crowd of men here, mostly college men and Southerners. <persName key="Ackerman, David Greenlie" from="1895" to="1968" role="2nd Lieutenant, Field Artillery">Dave Ackerman</persName> and <persName key="Blue, Harry Newton" from="1893" to="1925" role="1st Lieutenant, Field Artillery">Harry Blue</persName> are in my company (Company 1). We sleep in double-deckers. The fellow I share mine with is a Harvard man named Cox, assistant secretary of the Guarantee Trust Company, and a fine chap. Alongside of me is a Princeton man named Biddle, also a dandy fellow. All considered, they could not have picked a finer bunch of men.</p>
            <p>Now about the food! A sample day runs like this. Breakfast: Oatmeal, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, coffee, bread, milk, etc. Dinner: Roast Beef, mashed potatoes, and gravy, spinach, side vegetables, bread pudding, coffee or tea. Supper: French toast, stewed tomatoes, jam, salad, fruit or pudding, coffee.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>On Sunday we get a good roast of veal and ice cream. So, you see, the 'eats' are fine, and we get absolutely all we want of them. The cook is a regular army man, and we have half a dozen uniformed 'serving men' in each company. The days are as hot as blazes, but the nights are cool. In fact, last week I sometimes slept with two army blankets and a bathrobe over me.</p>

            <p>I received your letter and am glad to hear that you and "friend" are at the shore. It
               will do you both lots of good. Thank "friend" for the postal. It is very nice that
               you have a chance to get a commission but hold off and stay where you are. There are
               plenty to do the work.</p>
            <p>I had to run out just then and take a look at an aeroplane passing over the barracks
               - a big flying boat affair only about 500 feet up.</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>We see all kinds of interesting sights every day - new flying machine, search lights,
               boats and men of war.</p>
            <p>The work continues just about the same. We plug on geometry, trig, and physics; play
               war games, drill on the guns, attend lectures, <unclear>snatch</unclear> half an
               hours swim and wait for Sunday and rest to come.</p>
            <p>The hard thing is not being able to see home or any of you there. There is not the
               excitement of <placeName key="Fort Myer, VA" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=38_52_54_N_77_4_58_W">Fort
                  Myer</placeName> here and that is what makes things go harder. The kind of work we
               have to me however more than compensates for the grind.</p>
            <p> If we go to France it will </p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>be with heavy field and <sic>seige</sic> guns. Some of us will probably be there by
               fall. Don't tell anyone about that however. It would scare my aunt to death. She
               thinks that none of us will ever leave the country.</p>
            <p>Give my best to the "gang" Tell <unclear>Dave</unclear> that I will write him soon

            <p> I find in making arrangements for disposing of my estate in case anything happens to
               me that I have a couple of rather valuable instruments and one very valuable book
               that I would like to leave to the College as I think they would be used and appreciated there more than
               anywhere else.</p>
            <p> These are: One <unclear>microscope</unclear> with several rather fine English made
                  <pb n="10"/> lenses and French slides which I think are of biological subjects;
               One astronomical instrument built like a sextant, very old and probably an antique but
               probably of some service; a book which was written in 1662 (or published at that
               time) about science in general and a reference in it about communication by magnetic
               attraction which is quite singular. </p>

            <p> Thank you very much for <sic>yourletter</sic> of May 27th concerning <persName key="Ainsworth, William Penn Esterbrook" from="1893" to="1968" role="Captain, Coast Artillery Corps" ref="https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/L5L1-516">Pete</persName>. I
               shall most certainly write to him at least once a week and shall also send him our
               regular college circular which contains the college news. I was mighty sorry that he
               did not drop up to see me the last time he was in Rahway. This is the only time since
               he entered the service that he has neglected us and we did not have a chance,
               therefore, to say good bye to him, however, let us all hope that he may get back
               again soon and that the old good times will be renewed. </p>

               situated that it hardly seems I am in a country which has been at war for four years.
               Of course I am in a place very many miles from the firing line which accounts for the
               tranquility. You must understand, while I censor my own mail, that I cannot reveal
               many things and must deal largely in generalities in writing you. </p>

               "friend-wife" and "Mike" I hope both are as well as ever and suppose "Mike" is
               growing everyday. Tickle him for me. ) </p>
            <p>The trip over was wonderful. The sea was very calm and the weather beautiful all the
               way over except for about two days when it blew up rather rough and as the seas
               caught us sideways the boat rocked to beat the band. It sometimes rocked so that for
               hours if you were sitting on deck you were looking alternatively at the sky above and
               the water beneath you and unless you braced your steamer chair you would slide, chair
               and all across the deck. Many of the men were dreadfully seasick but it did not
               effect me in the least, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>I have often heard what <pb n="19"/>
               <add place="margin">[3]</add> a wonderful sight land is after days at sea but never
               realized it until I saw it at the end of our voyage.</p>
            <p> Of our debarking and train trip I may say little except that the scenery was
               wonderful but in a different way from America. Our beautiful sections as a rule are
               the wild ones but the beautiful sections of France are often the cultivated ones.</p>
            <p>At present our company is billetted in an old French estate surrounded by vineyards.
               The officers live in the chateau which is a great white stone house with a tile roof
               (one of the originals from which the millionnaires take their plans for their seaside
               homes)</p>
            <p>I have a nice big room with an adjoining second floor parlour. In back there is a
               terrace with a <pb n="20"/> palm and rose garden containing a wonderful pagoda. A
               brook with a deep swimming hole runs <sic>thru</sic> a nearby meadow and affords the
               men an opportunity for bathing. The days are very warm and the nights cool.</p>
            <p>What more could one ask for?</p>
            <p>I am very well and very happy and, I believe, very fortunate.</p>
            <p>I will write in the near future and want you to do that little thing very often.</p>

            </opener>
            <p> I have received several of the College Letters but as yet no real letters from
               yourself telling me all of the latest gossip. What is the matter? I know that it must
               be several weeks since I last wrote you but time goes so fast over here that it seems
               but yesterday. For five weeks none of us received a letter from the U.S.; when they
               finally arrived however they came in a bunch and we had to knock-off for about two
               days to read them all. </p>
            <p> Some time ago I was in a large city near here and who should I meet in the Y.M.C.A.
               but <persName key="Ludlow, Charles" from="1895" to-iso="19--" role="Seaman, Navy" cert="low">Chip Ludlow</persName> all decked out in his naval uniform and looking
               very snappy. I made an appointment and dined with him the next day. It was awfully
               good to see him and get all of the home news first hand. I have not had the chance to
               get to <seg xml:id="fn5">Base Hospital #8</seg>
               <note type="annotation" target="#fn5">
                  <p>According to Joe Costa, there were at least 8 Rutgers men stationed at Base

            <p> We are still located in the same place, living comfortably and working like the
               devil. Of my work I can say little as I have little time to spend in gadding around
               my letters are bound to be very uninteresting. The war news of the past few weeks has
               been very good as you of course know. I have talked with men who have been "in" the
               big drive and some of their stories and are wonderful. I wish I could tell them all.
               I may have a few of my own some day. I have seen many german prisoners. Nearly all of
               them strapping men and well set-up but with the face of a machine unlike the
               Americans or French. Some have long beards a foot long. </p>

            <p>I have been neglecting you for the past two or three weeks, but we have all been so
               busy trying to make Rutgers a war college that there has been absolutely no time for
               anything else, except the immediate work which we are trying to do. Even now there is
               only the chance for this brief note.</p>

               college is now on a <seg xml:id="fn7">distinct war footing</seg><note type="annotation" target="#fn7">
                  <p>The October 3, 1918 edition of The Targum discusses the cessation of fraternity

               fraternity meetings may be held, so it looks very much as if the chapters will have
               rather hard sledding. There are now 10 Delts in College, Jimmy Losee, LeCraw, L. Sherwin, Bob Farley, Newall Chase, Carleton Jones, and four freshmen you do not know. We are hoping that enough men will be left when things are adjusted, to start the chapter organization again. </p>

            <p> What was my surprise to receive a couple of letters from you the last few days. I
               was glad to see that you had a few good days at the seashore with the <persName key="Terrill, Edith Irona" from="1893" to="1966" role="Spouse of Earl Reed Silvers" ref="https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LCRM-W14">wife</persName>
               and son. Has "friend" taught the kid to swim yet? I have been less fortunate in not
               having had a swim this year. I expect however in the future sometime to more than
               make up for the lost time. </p>
            <p> According to your letters <pb n="25"/>
               <add place="margin">(2)</add> the changes at College must be very radical. I am sorry
               on account of the fraternity but otherwise the new routine must be very interesting. </p>
            <p> Since the last writing I have been doing the usual moving around from place to place
               tring to keep up with a very active war. Yesterday I went <sic>thru</sic> what had
               been no-man's land a few days before but is now ours. I had lunch in an old

               rusty barbed wire, shells, trenches all tell of the long struggle. In places entire
               forests have been shot from the hills leaving not a single visible tree. </p>
            <p> I am living in an old French shed. It is quite dark and full of rats but we have
               made it fairly comfortable. The orderly stole a stove somewhere and we are gradually

            <p> I have not heard from you in a long time but presume that things are going smoothly
               as usual. How was the news of peace, the abdication of the Kaiser Etc received in the
               States. I'll bet there was some <unclear>demonstration</unclear> particularly by
               those about to be drafted. Please <pb n="29"/>

            <p> We are just sitting tight at present awaiting orders. We may be sent to Germany on
               occupation work or home. I am hoping for the latter. </p>
            <p> Let me say that it was a great relief to the news when peace was announced. We had

            <p>One day we received hurry up orders to leave for the front. It took five teams to get
               our regiment up. We got off, after a three day ride and received orders to get into

                     <p>As an officer with the 57th Coast Artillery Corps, Ainsworth would have participated in the St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne Operations in support of 1st U.S. Army in France until the Armistice</p>
                  <ref target="https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Saint-Mihiel-1918">Gilbert, Adrian. Battle of Saint-Mihiel.</ref></note>. You never saw such a
               hurry in your life. It so happened that one of our battalions (the first to arrive)
               after working like dogs got into position only to learn that the infantry had gone
               clear beyond their range. They never fired a shot in that battle. Before leaving
               Libourne we had lost one battalion to railway artillery and had given another that
               was already at the front. The latter was in the <placeName key="Saint-Mihiel, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_53_21_N_05_32_37_E"> St.
                  Mehile</placeName> battle and did very good work. </p>
            <p>After that job was done we proceeded to the historic field before Verdun. Here we
               started our party. We had, in the Argonne Offensive, as you have probably read, the
               hardest job any army ever had. I was in it from beginning to end. The "bosche"
               divisions were in front of us so thick that it was nearly impossible to write all of
               their numbers on the map. The country was hilly and wooded and most difficult and
               costly to fight over. It was during this fight that I took over the Headquarters
               Company. In the middle of this fight while we were at Eppinonville (West of
               Montfaucon) that we received a new Colonel who certainly was a fire-eater.</p>
            <p>One of his first actions was to move us nearly into the front line trenches at
               <seg xml:id="fn28">Romogne</seg><note type="annotation" target="#fn28"><p>Romagne-sous-Montfaucon, Meuse</p></note>. One afternoon I started with my company in ten big trucks for our new
               location. Our road led us across a field in full view of the "bosche" who were about
               a mile distant. Right in the middle of the field the first truck dropped <pb n="34"/>
               <add place="margin">-3-</add>
               into a shell hole. It took three quarters of an hour to get it out and have never
               been able to figure out why fire was not opened up on us. As it was they did not
               start until we were off of the road. </p>
            <p>In our new location we lived in a little cabin about 1 1/2 kilometers (1 mile) from
               the "bosche" for six days. We were shelled all of the time and gassed part of the
               time especially at night. Officers and men were killed. My company lost quite
               heavily. I had trucks and cars hit. Often at night shell fragments and dirt hit our
               cabin and we slept with our masks handy.</p>
            <p>There was one place in full view of our house where the "bosche" liked to shell and
               in the evenings we used to sit on the porch, hear the shells come over the hill,
               whistle over our heads and see them crash down the valley. It was very
               entertaining.</p>
            <p>But when the drive of November 1st started things changed considerably. I shall never
               forget the barrage our guns let loose that night. I sat in a dug-out we had
               constructed under the floor of our cabin with a phone glued to my ear keeping in
               touch with the battalions and our brigade and otherwise trying to run the operations
               of the regiment.</p>
            <p>The sky was just one glare of lights. We had a gun under every bush and when they let
               loose you would think that all Hell had popped. Fritz suddenly started to leave the
               territory and he never stopped. I don't blame him a bit for the business end of our
               fire must have been hell itself.</p>
            <p>That was the last big party. We followed Fritz to the place I am at present, near
               Stenay on the Meuse. When we got here the armistice was signed and we are just
               sitting tight awaiting developments.</p>

                  <p>A replacement depot was a holding area for troops that were not yet assigned to a

               Yesterday I returned from my first leave at <placeName key="Nice, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_42_12_N_7_15_59_E">Nice</placeName> and found awaiting me a huge bundle of mail, including some from you, which had been sent all over France to my various addresses and finally caught up. I cannot realize how big "Mike" must be to walk &amp; talk. The last time I saw him he was such a little fellow. I am afraid he wont recognize me at all.
               <pb n="49"/><!-- I think this letter is out of order -->
               Congratulations on the new home. I certainly hope you will enjoy it.

               I have just finished the most wonderful two weeks I have ever put in. I just went to <placeName key="Marseille, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_17_47_N_5_22_12_E">Marseille</placeName> where I spent one day and then on to <placeName key="Nice, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_42_12_N_7_15_59_E">Nice</placeName> where I spent eight days on the shore of the Mediterranean in climate such as we have at Florida in the winter. All I did was sleep, eat, automobile, dance and play tennis. The county is simply wonderful. Huge palm trees, the almond trees in bloom, the orange trees covered covered with fruit, the olive trees green like the grass. All of this

               foliage with the sea a dark blue green and the snow clad Alps in the distance made a picture I will never forget. I certainly will come back to it some day. I went to <placeName key="Monaco" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_43_59_N_7_25_0_E">Monaco</placeName>, <placeName key="Monte Carlo, Monaco" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=43_44_23_N_7_25_38_E">Monte Carlo</placeName> and over the Italian border as far as they would let me. I met some wonderful French and Italian girls who danced and played tennis wonderfully so you can well imagine I managed to have a good time. On the way back I went up through the <placeName key="French Alps" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=45_49_58_N_6_51_54_E">French Alps</placeName> and never expect to see such scenery again as long as I live.

               I am back now, however, to the land of rain and mud with a coat of tan entirely out of place and in wonderful condition to go back on the job.
