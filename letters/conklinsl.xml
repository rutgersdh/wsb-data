                    deepest sympathy. To have known Sherman was to have loved him, and this we all
                    did and,we think, he returned our affection, so that we also have suffered a
                    great loss. Sherman's unfailing good nature, his ready sympathy and his
                    eagerness to be always doing something for someone else, were <seg xml:id="fn2"

                            1918, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for saving the life of a
                            comrade whose clothing had been set on fire by an explosion of gasoline.
                            He himself was so badly burned that he was confined to the hospital for
                            two months. Immediately after his release, he returned to duty,
                            performing brave and splendid service until he met his death at the
                            village of Montgobert.</quote><ref

                    "Cub”, as we called him, not one of us ever heard him say one word in anger <sic>noe</sic>
                    express even one unkind thought of anyone. Indeed, the memory of his great heart
                    and larger nature will always remain one of our most cherished possessions.</p>


                <p>Our sorrow and our loss are too great to be conveyed in words, but we want you to
                    know how much we loved Sherman, and that we can never forget him. We shall be
                    always guided by the example he set us, and when we most miss him, we shall try
                    to remember that his call found him ready and unafraid to answer, and that he
                    gave his life in the greatest work of this great cause, the relief of pain and
                    torture.</p>

                <p>
                    Sherman's death was a big shock to his many
                    friends at the college. His life was so full of promise that
                    it seemed wrong, somehow, to have it cut off so abruptly. But
                    it must be a world of comfort to you to have hod such a son. I
                    am sure that he died with a smile on his lips, and with the knowledge 
                    that he had not made so splendid a sacrifice in vain. We
                    Rutgers men are very proud of him.

                    <salute>Dear Mrs.Conklin</salute>

                <p>I would gladly send you fifty copies of the October issue of the Quarterly if we
                    had them, but calls have been so frequent and many that there are only twenty
                    left. For college records and filing purposes, we should really have more than
                    that number. </p>

                <p>I think, however, that by dropping a line to a few of <persName

                        >Sherman</persName>’s classmates, I can gather a few extra copies together.
                    Under separate cover I am mailing you six.</p>

                <p>Please do not bother about their cost. I am very sorry that I cannot send you a
                    great many more.</p>

                <p>Just as soon as things are straightened out here at the college, I shall take up
                    the matter of collecting <seg xml:id="fn4">Sherman's writings</seg><note
