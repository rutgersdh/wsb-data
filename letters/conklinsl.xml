                    deepest sympathy. To have known Sherman was to have loved him, and this we all
                    did and,we think, he returned our affection, so that we also have suffered a
                    great loss. Sherman's unfailing good nature, his ready sympathy and his
                    eagerness to be always doing something for someone else, were <seg xml:id="fn3">an inspiration</seg><note type="annotation" target="#fn3"><quote>In January

                            comrade whose clothing had been set on fire by an explosion of gasoline.
                            He himself was so badly burned that he was confined to the hospital for
                            two months. Immediately after his release, he returned to duty,
                            performing brave and splendid service until he met his death at the
                            village of Montgobert.</quote><ref target="https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/T34M97D7">Silvers, E. R. Obituaries

                    "Cub", as we called him, not one of us ever heard him say one word in anger

                    of his great heart and larger nature will always remain one of our most
                    cherished possessions.</p>


                <p>Our sorrow and our loss are too great to be conveyed in words, but we want you to
                    know how much we loved Sherman, and that we can never forget him. We shall be
                    always guided by the example he set us, and when we most miss him, we shall try
                    to remember that his call found him ready and unafraid to answer, and that he
                    gave his life in the greatest work of this great cause, the relief of pain and
                    torture.</p>

                    tried to beat the fire with his hands. They tell me he succeeded in saving the
                    man’s life, but was badly burned - They were both taken to the Hospital &amp;
                    have the best of care - but of course Sherman cannot write with bandaged <pb n="6"/> hands - The new treatment spraying with wax seems almost miraculous
                    in its effects. Both boys are getting well - the other one was more seriously

                <p>Nothing could have been nearer to Sherman’s desire concerning, if necessary, than
                    were the actual circumstances. He was waiting for his load of wounded at our
                    farthest post in front of the village of <placeName key="Montgobert, France" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_18_22_N_3_8_56_E">Montgobert</placeName>, a little north of the <placeName key="Villers-Cotterêts, France" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_15_36_N_3_05_26_E">Villers Cotterets</placeName>. At the time he was speaking to a French
                    priest who is attached to one of the regiments. The shell struck in the midst of
                    the little group killing Sherman <hi rend="underline">instantly</hi> and
                    wounding several others. He died as he had wished with a smile on his lips, and
                    for the lives of the men who fall. The body was laid at rest the next day in the
                    little village cemetery of <placeName key="Taillefontaine, France" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_18_43_N_3_02_36_E">Taillefontaine</placeName> and the spot is marked with a cross. The French
                    Catholic mass was read while cannon roared in the valley at one side and
                    shrapnel burst over the other side.</p>

                <p> We are anxious to have Sherman's picture in the October issue of the <seg xml:id="fn6">RUTGERS ALUMNI QUARTERLY</seg><note type="annotation" target="#fn6" resp="#sm">
                        <p>The first incarnation of what is now the Rutgers Magazine </p>
                        <ref target="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/alumni/rutgers_magazine">Rutgers University Libraries</ref>
                    </note> together with a full account of his life and death. We shall be very
                    grateful if you will send us a photograph of him; also whatever details you may
                    have about his death. perhaps a letter or two from his comrades, or a letter
                    from Sherman himself. Everything will be well taken care of and returned to you
                    undamaged within a week of its receipt. </p>
                <p> Sherman's death was a big shock to his many friends at the college. His life was
                    so full of promise that it seemed wrong, somehow, to have it cut off so
                    abruptly. But it must be a world of comfort to you to have had such a son. I am
                    sure that he died with a smile on his lips, and with the knowledge that he had
                    not made so splendid a sacrifice in vain. We Rutgers men are very proud of him. </p>

                    for the Alumni Quarterlies which were sent you. I hope you do not mind, but I am
                    returning your check. It is very good of you to send it but the Alumni Quarterly
                    is at present self-supporting and we are only too glad to be able to serve in
                    sending to Sherman's family copies of the magazine containing his 'In

                    much for him.</p>

                <p>It was very kind to let us have all of those copies of the Quarterly, and I
                    cannot half thank you - I feel as if I should not ask for any more copies
                    without paying for them - There are so <pb n="37"/> many of Sherman's
                    friends, who would not see the Quarterly to whom I want to send copies - I am
                    thinking of the men in his Ambulance Section in France, and of others.</p>
                <p>Would it be possible for us to have more copies? I will be so glad to pay for
                    them <pb n="38"/> with kind regards &amp; thanks for your great kindness, and
                    memories of hearing of happy hours Sherman spent with <unclear>you</unclear></p>

                <p>I would gladly send you fifty copies of the October issue of the Quarterly if we
                    had them, but calls have been so frequent and many that there are only twenty
                    left. For college records and filing purposes, we should really have more than
                    that number. </p>

                <p>I think, however, that by dropping a line to a few of Sherman’s classmates, I can gather a few extra copies together.
                    Under separate cover I am mailing you six.</p>

                <p>Please do not bother about their cost. I am very sorry that I cannot send you a
                    great many more.</p>

                <p>Just as soon as things are straightened out here at the college, I shall take up
                    the matter of collecting <seg xml:id="fn7">Sherman's writings</seg><note type="annotation" target="#fn7"><p>Conklin wrote poetry and prose for the
