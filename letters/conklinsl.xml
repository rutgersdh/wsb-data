                <p>Our sorrow and our loss are too great to be conveyed in words, but we want you to
                    know how much we loved Sherman, and that we can never forget him. We shall be
                    always guided by the example he set us, and when we most miss him, we shall try
                    to remember that his call found him ready and unafraid to answer, and that he
                    gave his life in the greatest work of this great cause, the relief of pain and
                    torture.</p>

                <p>Nothing could have been nearer to Sherman’s desire concerning, if necessary, than were the actual circumstances. He was waiting for his load of wounded at our farthest post in front of the village of <placeName key="Montgobert, France" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_18_22_N_3_8_56_E">Montgobert</placeName>, a little north of the <placeName key="Villers-Cotterêts, France" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_15_36_N_3_05_26_E">Villers Cotterets</placeName>. At the time he was speaking to a French priest who is attached to one of the regiments. The shell struck in the midst of the little group killing Sherman <hi rend="underline">instantly</hi> and wounding several others. He died as he had wished with a smile on his lips, and for the lives of the men who fall. The body was laid at rest the next day in the little village cemetery of <placeName key="Taillefontaine, France" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=49_18_43_N_3_02_36_E">Taillefontaine</placeName> and the spot is marked with a cross. The French Catholic mass was read while cannon roared in the valley at one side and shrapnel burst over the other side.</p>

                    if you will send us a photograph of him; also whatever details

                    Sherman's death was a big shock to his many
                    friends at the college. His life was so full of promise that
                    it seemed wrong, somehow, to have it cut off so abruptly. But
                    it must be a world of comfort to you to have hod such a son. I
                    am sure that he died with a smile on his lips, and with the knowledge 
                    that he had not made so splendid a sacrifice in vain. We
                    Rutgers men are very proud of him.

                <p>I would gladly send you fifty copies of the October issue of the Quarterly if we
                    had them, but calls have been so frequent and many that there are only twenty
                    left. For college records and filing purposes, we should really have more than
                    that number. </p>

                <p>I think, however, that by dropping a line to a few of <persName key="Conklin, Sherman L." from="1894" to="1918" role="Private, Ambulence Corps" ref="https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/T34M97D7">Sherman</persName>’s classmates, I can gather a few extra copies together.
                    Under separate cover I am mailing you six.</p>

                <p>Please do not bother about their cost. I am very sorry that I cannot send you a
                    great many more.</p>

                <p>Just as soon as things are straightened out here at the college, I shall take up
                    the matter of collecting <seg xml:id="fn7">Sherman's writings</seg><note type="annotation" target="#fn7"><p>Conklin wrote poetry and prose for the
