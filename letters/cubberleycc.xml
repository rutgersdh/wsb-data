                    I am very sorry that I have neglected to return <persName key="Cubberley, Chester C." from="1897" to="1918" role="Cadet, Navel Reserve Force">Chester's</persName> picture and letter to you. I did not know that there was any immediate desire for it and I have not given it the attention which it should have had. I am sending you now under separate cover both the picture and letter but I am afraid that the rush of Christmas season will not permit your receiving it by Wednesday. However,
                    I sincerely hope that you do get it in time.
