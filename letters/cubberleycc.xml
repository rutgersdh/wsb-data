                <p>
                    I have been trying to find the time to drop you a few lines and have finally succeeded. I am no longer at <placeName key="Pelham Bay, NY" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_51_58_N_73_48_37_W">Pelham Bay</placeName> as you can see by the heading of my letter, but at Whitestone L.I.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am glad to hear that <persName key="Hartley, George R." from="1895" to="1947" role="Lieutenant" ref="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QK1G-SKR4">Rus Hartley</persName> is at <placeName key="Fort Totten, NY" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_47_31.3_N_73_46_33.9_w">Fort Totten</placeName> and will try to get in touch with him. The Fort is just a short way from our Base and is on the same side of the river.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am acting as bugler at the Base now and that gives me more time for studying than I had
                    <pb n="2"/>
                    at either <placeName key="Bensonhurst, NY" ref="https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_36_10_N_74_0_6_W">Bensonhurst</placeName> or Pelham Bay.

We are anxious to pay fitting tribute to his memory and to print as much about him as is possible in the October issue of the RUTGERS ALUMNI QUARTERLY. We shall be grateful for your kindness if you will send us a brief sketch of his life, his place and date of birth, schooling, etc., and his career in the Navy. A letter or two which he wrote while in <orig>servicewwould</orig> be of much value to the college. We would like his picture also, in uniform if possible. Everything which you may care to send us will be returned unharmed within a week of its receipt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        May I extend the sympathy of Chester’s friends here in college to you. His death came as a great shock to us, and we grieve with you.

                <p>Thank you very much for your letter of September 30th. I can wait until October 12th for the picture of Chester but in order to appear in our magazine it will have to be here by that date. Chester's picture and biography will appear in the October issue of the Rutgers Alumni Quarterly. If you will let us know how many copies you wish to have we shall be very pleased to send them to you free of charge. We can at least do that much for the mother of one of our Rutgers boys who has made the big sacrifice. I am <orig>inclosing</orig> a list of questions about Chester. If you will fill them out and return them to me at once I shall be able to include a story of his life with the photograph. I thank you for your interest.</p>

It will not be necessary, therefore, for you to call upon her for your aid in the matter. I hope that my request did not inconvenience you.

In talking
                    <pb n="19"/>
                    with his mother however I noticed that nothing appeared in the questions about his <unclear>devotion</unclear> to the church. Chester was very loyal to the Presbyterian Church of Long Branch of which he was a member and in which he was an active member
                    <pb n="20"/>
                    taking the lead in the Young Peoples work. He was a young fellow who had high ambitions and much determination to make the best of himself. I should have thought that he would have been the one least likely to perish but he was the first from the town to be taken. He is greatly mourned by his family.

                    <salute>
                        My dear Mrs. Cubberley:-</salute>
                </opener>
                
                <p>I am very sorry that I have neglected to return <persName key="Cubberley, Chester C." from="1897" to="1918" role="Cadet, Navel Reserve Force">Chester</persName>'s picture and letter to you. I did not know that there was any immediate desire for it and I have not given it the attention which it should have had. I am sending you now under separate cover both the picture and letter but I am afraid that the rush of Christmas season will not permit your receiving it by Wednesday. However, I sincerely hope that you do get it in time.</p>
                
                <p>I am also sending you the <seg xml:id="fn6">plate</seg> <note type="annotation" target="#fn6" resp="#mr"><p>Probably a getatin dry plate, regarded as a practical improvement upon the collodion negative process. Its period of greatest use was 1880 to 1900.</p><ref target="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/pst.000067784790?urlappend=%3Bseq=47">Kennel, Sarah.

Any good printer will strike off as many copies as you care to have, Please do not forget to return it as we are going to use Chester's picture in the permanent book which will issued some time with the next year and the cut is necessary for that publication.</p>
                <p>I thank you very much for your good Christmas wishes. 
                </p>
