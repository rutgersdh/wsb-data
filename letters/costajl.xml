					<salute>Dear <persName key="Osborn, George Augustus" from="1874" to="1963" role="Librarian, Rutgers College" cert="medium">George</persName> (&amp; Co.)</salute>
				</opener>

				<p>A lazy spell got a hold of me, and while I had all good intentions of dropping
					you a line as soon as I got here, between making purchases, getting settled, and
					the Red Cross girls, why, it just slipped along.</p>

				<p>First about our trip. It was a regular summer school. We had a Red Cross gang on
					board, and the trip was a <seg xml:id="fn1">series of pinochle, 500</seg><note target="#fn1" type="gloss"><p>Pinochle and 500 are card games.</p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_(card_game)">Wikipedia</ref></note>, and dancing, with much eating and drinking (?).
					There was lots of talk of submarines and torpedoes, but we did not encounter
					anything, being convoyed by two torpedo boat destroyers in the danger zone. Our
					boat was armed with a 2-6" and a 3". The last three days in the danger zone, the
					orders were to sleep with clothing and with life preservers. About half the fool
					passengers slept on deck during the whole <del rend="overstrike">d</del>trip,
					and dragged the life preservers where<del>v</del>ever they went, no matter if it
					was the drawing room or the dining room. The only trouble was that there were no
					lights allowed on deck at night, not even a smoke or <seg xml:id="fn2">Radiolite
						watch</seg><note type="gloss" target="#fn2"><p>Radiolite watches had dials
							that were painted with a radium coating that glowed in the dark.</p><ref target="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/stories/155134-radium-girls-and-radiolite-dial-watches">RADIUM GIRLS &amp; Radiolite Dial Watches</ref></note>, so we had to
					promenade the deck in the dark. Very convenient.</p>

				<p>Anyway, after 24 hours fooling with customs officials, and passports, etc. they
					let me come on to <placeName key="Paris, France" ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_51_24_N_2_21_08_E">Paris</placeName>, and take it from me, this is <hi rend="underline">Paris</hi>, even if it is wa<del rend="strikethrough">t</del>rtime.</p>

				<p>The only differences between war time Paris and peace time Paris are that prices
					are on the whole higher, lights never show up at night on the streets, and the
					place is gayer than usual. Theaters, etc. all go to full capacity, only the
					cheapest seat is about 15 francs. The</p>

				<note type="letterhead">Rutgers College<lb/>New Brunswick, New Jersey<lb/>Joseph L.
					Costa<lb/> Ford Dormitory</note>

				<p><add place="margin">-2- </add>cheapest shoes around town are 60-70 francs (10-12
					dollars) and the cheapest soap about 40¢ a small cake. Outside of these few
					commodities, however, things are either about the same as in America or cheaper.
					Fruits, vegetables, wine, etc. is much cheaper. They have this system of tickets
					for getting milk, coal, etc. but it works very well, that is, nobody goes short;
					there is plenty to go around. Another thing that is dear as anything is
					typewriters. The American a<del rend="strikethrough">f</del>rmy has cleaned up
					all machines in France, and the cheapest machine obtainable, a Remington 10,
					costs about $200. delivery in a month or two.</p>

				<p>Americans are <hi rend="underline">not</hi> as well looked on in France as they
					say in America. In fact, unless they are careful there is liable to be trouble.
					The trouble is that every town the army hits, prices go up from double to a
					hundred times, and the French people in town can't get anything any more. This
					is the case all over France, as our army is <sic>scatter</sic> all over the
					country, from 100 to 3000 in a village.</p>

				<p>Another trouble with this town is that the cars stop running at <del rend="overstrike">I</del>8 o'clock at night, the subway at 11 o'clock, and
						t<del rend="overstrike">x</del>axis don't run at all, so that is necessary
					to keep pre<del rend="overstrike">e</del>tty good hours or walk. I don't do
					either. I hang up at some relative in any quarter I happen to be.</p>

				<p>Can you possibly get <persName key="Hutchinson, William Thomas" from="1895" to="1976" role="Lieutenant, Marine Corps" ref="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79018069.html">Squirrel</persName>'s address, that is, the unit he is in?</p>
