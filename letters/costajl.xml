				<note><p>UK-born Joseph Costa, RC '22, was a naturalized US citizen. His father, August, was born in Paris, France, and might have been of Portuguese or Italian descent. Joseph joined the French Foreign Legion rather than the American Expeditionary Forces, perhaps out of loyalty to his father's place of birth. He was a Catholic, which might explain why his Rutgers friends called him "Pope" in many letters. Costa's letters indicate that he had a friendly relationship with both Luther Martin and George Osborn, the Rutgers College registrar and librarian respectively. In addition to being close colleagues, George, Luther, and Earl Reed Silvers were themselves quite close.</p> <p>Costa's letters, whether addressed to George or "Lu," ended up in Silvers's files. Costa's epistolary manner is warm and effusive, and he goes into great detail about the lives of the eight Rutgers men serving in the Medical Department at Base Hospital No. 8 in Savenay, France. He even repeats substantial portions in separate letters to Martin and Silvers. One imagines he was a bit envious of their camaraderie, all sleeping together in the same attic of the École Normale. The last three letters in Costa's file give a somewhat revealing look into his experiences in the French army; it is not known who they were addressed to or indeed if they were mailed on the dates given. Costa is one of the only Rutgers alumni to admit to feeling lonely in his letters. He closes his letter to "Lu" by saying: "Drop me a line now &amp; then as I am lonely as they make them."</p>

					<salute>Dear <persName key="Osborn, George Augustus" from="1874" to="1963"
							role="Librarian, Rutgers College" cert="medium">George</persName> (&amp;
						Co.)</salute>
				</opener>

				<p>A lazy spell got a hold of me, and while I had all good intentions of dropping
					you a line as soon as I got here, between making purchases, getting settled, and
					the Red Cross girls, why, it just slipped along.</p>

				<p>First about our trip. It was a regular summer school. We had a Red Cross gang on
					board, and the trip was a <seg xml:id="fn1">series of pinochle, 500</seg><note
						target="#fn1" type="gloss"><p>Pinochle and 500 are card games.</p><ref
							target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_(card_game)"
						>Wikipedia</ref></note>, and dancing, with much eating and drinking (?).
					There was lots of talk of submarines and torpedoes, but we did not encounter
					anything, being convoyed by two torpedo boat destroyers in the danger zone. Our
					boat was armed with a 2-6" and a 3". The last three days in the danger zone, the
					orders were to sleep with clothing and with life preservers. About half the fool
					passengers slept on deck during the whole <del rend="overstrike">d</del>trip,
					and dragged the life preservers where<del>v</del>ever they went, no matter if it
					was the drawing room or the dining room. The only trouble was that there were no
					lights allowed on deck at night, not even a smoke or <seg xml:id="fn2">Radiolite
						watch</seg><note type="gloss" target="#fn2"><p>Radiolite watches had dials
							that were painted with a radium coating that glowed in the dark.</p><ref
							target="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/stories/155134-radium-girls-and-radiolite-dial-watches"
							>RADIUM GIRLS &amp; Radiolite Dial Watches</ref></note>, so we had to
					promenade the deck in the dark. Very convenient.</p>

				<p>Anyway, after 24 hours fooling with customs officials, and passports, etc. they
					let me come on to <placeName key="Paris, France"
						ref="https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?params=48_51_24_N_2_21_08_E"
						>Paris</placeName>, and take it from me, this is <hi rend="underline"
						>Paris</hi>, even if it is wa<del rend="strikethrough">t</del>rtime.</p>

				<p>The only differences between war time Paris and peace time Paris are that prices
					are on the whole higher, lights never show up at night on the streets, and the

				<p>Got your letter while en route to the front so I waited until I got here to answer.</p>

					and corrugated iron. The Boche is quiet and only sends over a shell now and then. The first night I slept to the hole I got a dose of gas, but nothing much - two
					or three sneezes and that's all. Just think of me when you see a communique with something going on "south of the Aisne," for that is where I am.</p>
				<p>I am really having the time of my life. What do I have to do? Get up at 8 or 9, breakfast, write letters, eat at noon, take walks in the afternoon if the shelling is not heavy, eat supper, and go to bed. This is the life!</p>

				<p>This is the war here. Our battery position is now on the second German line,
					and you undoubtedly know all about the famous attack here. I am now before Soissons
					and we are always moving forward. I am living in one of those muddy trenches you
					read about to the Saturday Evening Post. It is impossible to make decent dugouts,
					as there are too many "stiffs" interred. The odor of the place, besides, is not
					at all invigorating.</p>
				<p>This whole drive is intensely interesting, the surprise having been complete.
					On the positions hereabout there are dead Germans caught on the stairs of the
					dugouts and in their holes. The Americans have done splendidly.</p>
				<p>There is an awful amount of junk left here. Every day the battery brings
					up a truck and we slip back German machine guns and munitions. All the men have
					their mess of booty, and there are quite a bunch of American affairs - rifles and
					equipment - strewn all over the fields. German batteries have been taken all harnessed up,
					and we are now using some to goad advantage. Thousands of machine
					guns are hanging around, and the guy that goes out and doesn't come back loaded
					can't find water in a river. We are still moving ahead. Let’s hope we keep
					going!</p>

				<p>Just the usual short line, shorter than usual because I am not in complete shape
					after the gas yet. I got it fairly mild, yet it knocked me out of shape quickly,
					although I have kept in line. I can see pretty well now and the burns are all
					healed up, but I cannot yet taste anything I eat and the cough doesn’t let me
					sleep. Quite optimistic, nevertheless. The sector has become quiet, and although
					Soissons is still the first line, one can safely roam around and give the empty
